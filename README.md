# Data Visualisation In Python 
The graphical representation of the data set to identify patters and trends out of it is called DATA VISUALISATION.

### And, here we have created a Python projects with Graphical Representation meathod.

Matplotlib is used for data visualisation in Python. Now we will know what Matplotlib is and what different kind of graph are there to represent data.

Matplotlib was created by John D.Hunter in 2003. It is a free and open source data visualisation liberty in python.

It comes with a verity of plots but the most used module of Matplotlib is Pyplot which is used for creating 2D plots of arrays.

## Installing Matplotlib 

• To install it using pip:
```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib 
```
• To install using Anaconda:
```bash
conda install natplotlib
```
Or
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib

```


#### And, we have to load Matplotlib to start plotting different graphs:

```bash
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


### • Scatter Plot
### • Bar Chart 
### • Pie Chart
### • Histogram 
### • Box Plot (Whisker Plot)
